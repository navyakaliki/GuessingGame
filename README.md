# Guessing Game
* UserInput
* secretNumber
* roundedNumber
* Count
## STAGE ONE:



Tried building a code as simple as possible 

    1.Firstly generated the random Number using Math.random
    2. As Math.Random() gives a double, converted that to a rounded integer by multiplying with 10
    3.So the Number are now inbetween 1-10
    4. Checked if UserInput equals to Rounded Number
    5.if yes user wins , if not user looses and system Exists 
    
##Stage Two:

Giving the User Unlimited Tries
    
    1.Created a While loop and keeps looping till the user wants to try again
    2.but if the Guess is right, system exists 
    
##Stage Three

Counting the number of tries User used :
    
    1.While loop being true, count keeps incrementing 
    till the right number is guessed.
